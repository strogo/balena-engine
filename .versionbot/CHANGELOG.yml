        Remove overlay2 layer files that are not in use on engine start [Kyle
        Harding]
      hash: 857521b7801b4a6abf02f8da4673e868cfbe702a
      body: |
        There is a problem pattern in support where layers are not being
        cleaned up properly and are eating up a device's storage.
        This problem has been with us for a while and we thought it was
        addressed in #203 but recent data points to this not being the case.

        It was decided that in the short term we should look at integrating
        the logic of this cleanup script into the engine startup.

      body: |
        Busybox in balenaOS is compiled with desktop mode disabled,
        so features like `-ef` and providing pids via `-q` are not
        supported. Add a 3rd condition to try ps with no args and allow
        parsePSOutput to filter by pid.

        Earlier engine versions were not properly persisting cacheID

        in layer metadata. As a result, because of abruptly terminated

        a lot of devices have unreferenced graphdriver layers on disk.


        With this change, the engine will be able to clean up such unreferenced
        layers.

      body: >-
        If the engine process is terminated during the layer extraction
        transaction,

        before Commit or Cancel is called on the transaction, a new FS layer can
        be created

        This change ensures we don't perform any actions on the graph driver
        storage until

        the FS layer ID (the cacheID) is  persisted as a part of the transaction
        data.


        We can use this data to clean up the graph driver storage on next
        process start

        deleting all data associated with the transactions terminated abruptly.

        Return empty return values on all methods except the build endpoint,
        which

        will panic if the tag is set.

        The previous implemenation lead to failing test where sometimes the

        This drops taking times and simply tests that the pull works with

      body: >-
        In case Tail=N parameter is requested, we need to show N lines.

        It does not make sense to walk backwards one by one if we can

        do it at once. Now, if Since=T is also provided, make sure we

        haven't jumped too far (before T), and if we did, move forward.

        The primary motivation for this was to make the code simpler.

        This also fixes a tiny bug in the "since" implementation.

        Before this commit:

        > $ docker logs -t --tail=6000 --since="2019-03-10T03:54:25.00" $ID |

      body: |-
        1. The journald client library initializes inotify watch(es)
        during the first call to sd_journal_get_fd(), and it make sense
        to open it earlier in order to not lose any journal file rotation
        events.
        2. It only makes sense to call this if we're going to use it
        later on -- so add a check for config.Follow.
        3. Remove the redundant call to sd_journal_get_fd().
        NOTE that any subsequent calls to sd_journal_get_fd() return
        the same file descriptor, so there's no real need to save it
        for later use in wait_for_data_cancelable().
        Based on earlier patch by Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com>.

      body: |-
        TL;DR: simplify the code, fix --follow hanging indefinitely
        Do the following to simplify the followJournal() code:
        1. Use Go-native select instead of C-native polling.
        2. Use Watch{Producer,Consumer}Gone(), eliminating the need
        to have journald.closed variable, and an extra goroutine.
        3. Use sd_journal_wait(). In the words of its own man page:
        > A synchronous alternative for using sd_journal_get_fd(),
        > sd_journal_get_events(), sd_journal_get_timeout() and
        > sd_journal_process() is sd_journal_wait().
        Unfortunately, the logic is still not as simple as it
        could be; the reason being, once the container has exited,
        journald might still be writing some logs from its internal
        buffers onto journal file(s), and there is no way to
        figure out whether it's done so we are guaranteed to
        read all of it back. This bug can be reproduced with
        something like
        > $ ID=$(docker run -d busybox seq 1 150000); docker logs --follow $ID
        > ...
        > 128123
        > $
        (The last expected output line should be `150000`).
        To avoid exiting from followJournal() early, add the
        following logic: once the container is gone, keep trying
        to drain the journal until there's no new data for at
        least `waitTimeout` time period.
        Should fix https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/575

      body: >-
        If we take a long time to process log messages, and during that time

        journal file rotation occurs, the journald client library will keep

        those rotated files open until sd_journal_process() is called.

        By periodically calling sd_journal_process() during the processing

        loop we shrink the window of time a client instance has open file

        descriptors for rotated (deleted) journal files.

        This code is modelled after that of journalctl [1]; the above
        explanation

        as well as the value of 1024 is taken from there.

        From the first glance, `docker logs --tail 0` does not make sense,
        as it is supposed to produce no output, but `tail -n 0` from GNU
        coreutils is working like that, plus there is even a test case
        (`TestLogsTail` in integration-cli/docker_cli_logs_test.go).
        Now, something like `docker logs --follow --tail 0` makes total
        sense, so let's make it work.
        (NOTE if --tail is not used, config.Tail is set to -1)

        Add a test case for creating a 8GB file inside a container.
        Due to a bug in tar-split this was failing in Docker 18.06.
        The file being created is sparse, so there's not much I/O
        happening or disk space being used -- meaning the test is
        fast and does not require a lot of disk space.

      subject: 'daemon.ContainerLogs(): fix resource leak on follow'
      body: |-
        When daemon.ContainerLogs() is called with options.follow=true
        (as in "docker logs --follow"), the "loggerutils.followLogs()"
        function never returns (even then the logs consumer is gone).
        As a result, all the resources associated with it (including
        an opened file descriptor for the log file being read, two FDs
        for a pipe, and two FDs for inotify watch) are never released.
        If this is repeated (such as by running "docker logs --follow"
        and pressing Ctrl-C a few times), this results in DoS caused by
        either hitting the limit of inotify watches, or the limit of
        opened files. The only cure is daemon restart.
        Apparently, what happens is:
        1. logs producer (a container) is gone, calling (*LogWatcher).Close()
        for all its readers (daemon/logger/jsonfilelog/jsonfilelog.go:175).
        2. WatchClose() is properly handled by a dedicated goroutine in
        followLogs(), cancelling the context.
        3. Upon receiving the ctx.Done(), the code in followLogs()
        (daemon/logger/loggerutils/logfile.go#L626-L638) keeps to
        send messages _synchronously_ (which is OK for now).
        4. Logs consumer is gone (Ctrl-C is pressed on a terminal running
        "docker logs --follow"). Method (*LogWatcher).Close() is properly
        called (see daemon/logs.go:114). Since it was called before and
        due to to once.Do(), nothing happens (which is kinda good, as
        otherwise it will panic on closing a closed channel).
        5. A goroutine (see item 3 above) keeps sending log messages
        synchronously to the logWatcher.Msg channel. Since the
        channel reader is gone, the channel send operation blocks forever,
        and resource cleanup set up in defer statements at the beginning
        of followLogs() never happens.
        Alas, the fix is somewhat complicated:
        1. Distinguish between close from logs producer and logs consumer.
        To that effect,
        - yet another channel is added to LogWatcher();
        - {Watch,}Close() are renamed to {Watch,}ProducerGone();
        - {Watch,}ConsumerGone() are added;
        *NOTE* that ProducerGone()/WatchProducerGone() pair is ONLY needed
        in order to stop ConsumerLogs(follow=true) when a container is stopped;
        otherwise we're not interested in it. In other words, we're only
        using it in followLogs().
        2. Code that was doing (logWatcher*).Close() is modified to either call
        ProducerGone() or ConsumerGone(), depending on the context.
        3. Code that was waiting for WatchClose() is modified to wait for
        either ConsumerGone() or ProducerGone(), or both, depending on the
        context.
        4. followLogs() are modified accordingly:
        - context cancellation is happening on WatchProducerGone(),
        and once it's received the FileWatcher is closed and waitRead()
        returns errDone on EOF (i.e. log rotation handling logic is disabled);
        - due to this, code that was writing synchronously to logWatcher.Msg
        can be and is removed as the code above it handles this case;
        - function returns once ConsumerGone is received, freeing all the
        resources -- this is the bugfix itself.
        While at it,
        1. Let's also remove the ctx usage to simplify the code a bit.
        It was introduced by commit a69a59ffc7e3d ("Decouple removing the
        fileWatcher from reading") in order to fix a bug. The bug was actually
        a deadlock in fsnotify, and the fix was just a workaround. Since then
        the fsnofify bug has been fixed, and a new fsnotify was vendored in.
        For more details, please see
        https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/27782#issuecomment-416794490
        2. Since `(*filePoller).Close()` is fixed to remove all the files
        being watched, there is no need to explicitly call
        fileWatcher.Remove(name) anymore, so get rid of the extra code.
        Should fix https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/37391

      subject: Loosen permissions on /etc/docker directory
      body: >-
        The `/etc/docker` directory is used both by the dockerd daemon

        and the docker cli (if installed on the saem host as the daemon).

        In situations where the `/etc/docker` directory does not exist,

        and an initial `key.json` (legacy trust key) is generated (at the

        default location), the `/etc/docker/` directory was created with

        0700 permissions, making the directory only accessible by `root`.

        Given that the `0600` permissions on the key itself already protect

        it from being used by other users, the permissions of `/etc/docker`

        can be less restrictive.

        This patch changes the permissions for the directory to `0755`, so

        that the CLI (if executed as non-root) can also access this directory.

        > **NOTE**: "strictly", this patch is only needed for situations where
        no _custom_

        > location for the trustkey is specified (not overridden with
        `--deprecated-key-path`),

        > but setting the permissions only for the "default" case would make

        > this more complicated.

        causing events to be handled both by the "plugin" client, and

      body: |-
        With the previous code if two layers had identical contents (and diff
        ids) but different parents (and different chain ids) they would be
        considered common and skipped.
        However the pulling code uses the chain id to decide whether it should
        pull a layer so a delta created under these conditions was leading to
        the pulling code trying to apply a non-existent delta.
        This is fixed by using the same logic with chain ids in the generation
        phase.

      subject: 'pull: rely on memory cgroups to avoid page cache thrashing'
      body: |-
        This improves the previous attempt at reducing page cache thrashing
        introduced in 8c0ceab ("pkg/archive: use fadvise to prevent pagecache
        thrashing"). While the approached worked, it introduced severe delays
        during pull especially on high latency hard drives since it had to wait
        for every file.
        A much better approach implemented in this commit is to run the
        unpacking process in a memory constrained cgroup to limit the maximum
        page cache usage while at the same time hinting the kernel to start the
        writeback as soon as possible to reduce the amount of dirty pages as
        much as possible.
        This makes `balena pull` as fast as `docker pull && sync` while having
        minimal impact on page cache usage.

      subject: Use commit-sha instead of tag for containerd
      body: >-
        The `docker info` command compares the installed version

        of containerd using a Git-sha. We currently use a tag for

        this, but that tag is not returned by the version-API of

        containerd, resulting in the `docker info` output to show:

        containerd version: 89623f28b87a6004d4b785663257362d1658a729 (expected:
        v1.0.0)

        This patch changes the `v1.0.0` tag to the commit that

        corresponds with the tag, so that the `docker info` output

        does not show the `expected:` string.

        This should be considered a temporary workaround; the check

        for the exact version of containerd that's installed was needed

        when we still used the 0.2.x branch, because it did not have

        stable releases yet.

        With containerd reaching 1.0, and using SemVer, we can likely

        do a comparison for "Major" version, or make this a "packaging"

        issue, and remove the check entirely (we can still _print_ the

        version that's installed if we think it's usefule).

        With the contianerd 1.0 migration we now have strongly typed errors that
        we can check for process not found.
        We also had some bad error checks looking for `ESRCH` which would only
        be returned from `unix.Kill` and never from containerd even though we
        were checking containerd responses for it.
        Fixes some race conditions around process handling and our error checks
        that could lead to errors that propagate up to the user that should not.

        start extracting as soon as the data starts coming from the network.
        This reduces the free space required for a docker pull to happen since
        there are no temp files.
        Digest verification happens when the last byte of the layer is read.
        If verification fails we return an error that will cascade to the layer
        store and cancel the pull.

        Containers that are meant to be booted from do not need the initLayer.
        The default init layer shadows /etc/resolv.conf and other files from the
        filesystem but this can cause problems if we're bootstrapping the
        system.

        This patch makes sure the layer contents are synced to disk before
        reporting the ApplyDiff operation as successful. This prevents
        /var/lib/docker corruption but the method used here is not the most
        efficient since it will sync all the currently mounted filesystems.

      body: |-
        We've seen cases where container config on disk is a valid JSON but
        misses the Config object. Due to the way docker loads it in memory, it
        can cause a nul pointer exception.
        This patch checks for that and doesn't load the container in this case

      subject: 'pkg/archive: use fadvise to prevent pagecache thrashing'
      body: |-
        During a docker pull a very large amount of files are touched during
        unpacking. This causes linux to fill up the page cache with entries that
        most probably won't be used.
        There are two issues with this. The first one is that by putting a lot
        of pressure on the page cache memory fragmentation occurs. This can
        cause filesystem corruption on some platforms that can't handle memory
        allocation failures correctly.
        The second issue is that by not hinting our intentions to the kernel, we
        might evict useful pages from the cache that could be in use by some
        running container, and therefore affecting the performance of the
        application.
